# EnDFM

Enhancing Diffusion Fusion Model (EnDFM) is a deep learning model that aims to enhance both the semantics and the quality of a given scanning. It is a concatenated model that consists of two main parts: a Denoising Diffusion Fusion Module ([MMIF-DDFM](https://github.com/Zhaozixiang1228/MMIF-DDFM)) and a Single-Image Super-Resolution Module ([DiWa](https://github.com/Brian-Moser/diwa)).
